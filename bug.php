This code suffers from a subtle issue related to how PHP handles type juggling and comparisons.  Specifically, the `==` operator performs loose comparison, leading to unexpected results when comparing strings and numbers.

```php
<?php
$a = '10';
$b = 10;
if ($a == $b) {
  echo "The values are equal.";
} else {
  echo "The values are not equal.";
}
?>
```

While it might seem obvious that '10' and 10 are equal, in loose comparison PHP converts the string '10' to an integer before comparison. This is fine in most cases, but can lead to hard-to-find errors when comparing against other string values such as '10a'. 

This is further complicated when dealing with `empty()` and `isset()`.  Empty strings and the number zero are both considered 'falsy', which can lead to incorrect evaluations.
