The solution is to use strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`). Strict comparison does not perform type juggling; it checks both the value and the type of the operands.  This eliminates the unexpected results.

```php
<?php
$a = '10';
$b = 10;
if ($a === $b) {
  echo "The values are strictly equal.";
} else {
  echo "The values are not strictly equal.";
}

//Further illustrating with empty() and isset()
$x = '0'; //string
$y = 0;   //integer

if ($x == $y){ //Loose, shows equal
  echo "Loose comparison considers them equal.\n";
}

if ($x === $y){ //Strict, shows not equal
  echo "Strict comparison considers them different.\n";
}

?>
```

By using strict comparison, you ensure that the values are identical in both type and value, making your code more robust and less prone to these types of unexpected behaviors.
